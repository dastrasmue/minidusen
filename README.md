Minidusen [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/makandra/minidusen.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/makandra/minidusen)
=========

Low-tech search solution for ActiveRecord with MySQL or PostgreSQL
------------------------------------------------------------------

Minidusen lets you filter ActiveRecord models with a single query string.
It works with your existing MySQL or PostgreSQL schema by mostly relying on simple `LIKE` queries. No additional indexes, tables or indexing databases are required.

Minidusen accepts a single, Google-like query string and converts it into `WHERE` conditions for [an ActiveRecord scope](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html#conditions).

The following type of queries are supported:

- `foo` (case-insensitive search for `foo` in developer-defined columns)
- `foo bar` (rows must include both `foo` and `bar`)
- `"foo bar"` (rows must include the phrase `"foo bar"`)
- `-bar` (rows must not include the word `bar`)
- `filetype:pdf` (developer-defined filter for file type)
- `some words 'a phrase' filetype:pdf -excluded -'excluded  phrase' -filetype:pdf` (combination of the above)

Minidusen is a quick way to implement find-as-you-type filters for index views:

![A list of records filtered by a query](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/makandra/minidusen/master/doc/filtered_index_view.png)

We have found it to scale well for many thousand records. It's probably not a good idea to use Minidusen for hundreds of thousands of records or very long text columns. For this we recommend to use PostgreSQL with [pg_search](https://github.com/Casecommons/pg_search) or full-text databases like [Solr](https://github.com/sunspot/sunspot).


Installation
------------

In your `Gemfile` say:

```ruby
gem 'minidusen'
```

Now run `bundle install` and restart your server.


Basic Usage
-----------

Our example will be a simple address book:

```ruby
class Contact < ActiveRecord::Base
  validates_presence_of :name, :street, :city, :email
end
```

We create a new class `ContactFilter` that will describe the searchable columns:

```ruby
class ContactFilter
  include Minidusen::Filter

  filter :text do |scope, phrases|
    columns = [:name, :email]
    scope.where_like(columns => phrases)
  end

end
```

We can now use `ContactFilter` to filter a scope of `Contact` records:

```ruby
# We start by building a scope of all contacts.
# No SQL query is made.
all_contacts = Contact.all
# => ActiveRecord::Relation

# Now we filter the scope to only contain contacts with "gmail" in either :name or :email column.
# Again, no SQL query is made.
gmail_contacts = ContactFilter.new.filter(all_contacts, 'gmail')
# => ActiveRecord::Relation

# Inspect the filtered scope.
gmail_contacts.to_sql
# => "SELECT * FROM contacts WHERE name LIKE '%gmail%' OR email LIKE '%gmail%'"

# Finally we load the scope to produce an array of Contact records.
gmail_contacts.to_a
# => Array
```

### Filtering scopes with existing conditions

Note that you can also pass a scope with existing conditions to `ContactFilter#filter`. The returned scope will contain both the existing conditions and the conditions from the filter:

```ruby
published_contacts = Contact.where(published: true)
# => ActiveRecord::Relation

published_contacts.to_sql
# => "SELECT * FROM contacts WHERE (published = 1)"

gmail_contacts = ContactFilter.new.filter(published_contacts, 'gmail')
# => ActiveRecord::Relation

gmail_contacts.to_sql
# => "SELECT * FROM contacts WHERE (published = 1) AND (name LIKE '%gmail%' OR email LIKE '%gmail%')"
```

### How `where_like` works

The example above uses `where_like`. You can call `where_like` on any scope to produce a new scope where the given array of column names must contain all of the given phrases.

Let's say we call `ContactFilter.new.filter(Contact.published, 'foo "bar baz" bam')`. This will call the block `filter :text do |scope, phrases|` with the following arguments:

```ruby
scope == Contact.published
phrases == ['foo', 'bar baz', 'bam']
```

The scope `scope.where_like(columns => phrases)` will now represent the following SQL query:

```ruby
SELECT * FROM contacts
WHERE (name LIKE "%foo%" OR email LIKE "%foo") AND (email LIKE "%foo%" OR email LIKE "%foo")
```

You can also use `where_like` to find all the records *not* matching some phrases, using the `:negate` option:

```ruby
Contact.where_like(name: 'foo', negate: true)
```

Processing queries for qualified fields
---------------------------------------

Google supports queries like `filetype:pdf` that filters records by some criteria without performing a full text search. Minidusen gives you a simple way to support such search syntax.

Let's support a query like `email:foo@bar.com` to explictly search for a contact's email address, without filtering against other columns.

We can learn this syntax by adding a `filter:email` instruction
to our `ContactFilter` class`:

```ruby
class ContactFilter
  include Minidusen::Filter

  search_by :email do |scope, email|
    scope.where(emai: email)
  end

  search_by :text do |scope, phrases|
    columns = [:name, :email]
    scope.where_like(columns => phrases)
  end

end
```

We can now explicitly search for a user's e-mail address:

```ruby
ContactFilter.new.filter(Contact, 'email:foo@bar.com').to_sql
# => "SELECT * FROM contacts WHERE email='foo@bar.com'"
```

### Caveat

If you search for a phrase containing a colon (e.g. `deploy:rollback`), Minidusen will mistake the first part as a – nonexistent – qualifier and return an empty set.

To prevent that, search for a phrase:

    "deploy:rollback"


Supported Rails versions
------------------------

Minidusen is tested on:

- Rails 3.2
- Rails 4.2
- Rails 5.0
- MySQL 5.6
- PostgreSQL

If you need support for platforms not listed above, please submit a PR!


Development
-----------

- We currently develop using Ruby 2.2.4 (see `.ruby-version`) since that version works for all versions of ActiveRecord that we support.
- There are tests in `spec`. We only accept PRs with tests.
- Put your database credentials into `spec/support/database.yml`. There's a `database.sample.yml` you can use as a template.
- Create a database `minidusen_test` in both MySQL and PostgreSQL.
- There are gem bundles in `gemfiles` for each combination of ActiveRecord version and database type that we support.
- You can bundle all test applications by saying `bundle exec rake all:install`
- You can run specs from the project root by saying `bundle exec rake all:spec`.

If you would like to contribute:

- Fork the repository.
- Push your changes **with passing specs**.
- Send me a pull request.

Note that we're very eager to keep this gem lightweight. If you're unsure whether a change would make it into the gem, [talk to me beforehand](mailto:henning.koch@makandra.de).
